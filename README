# First commit

To start with the command line, initalize a python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`.
The virtual environment must then be activated with `source venv/bin/activate`.
A virtual environment insures that installed packages will not leak out of this project.
To exit the virtual environment at any time, the command `deactivate` can be issued.
